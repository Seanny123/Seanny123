# Hey! I'm Sean Aubin!

I'm a punk trained in Electrical Engineering and [Theoretical Neuroscience](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/people/sean-aubin.html), which means I'm a data generalist competent in Machine Learning. You can reach me casually [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/voyageur_techno). I also have [a blog](https://seanaubin.com/) that usually updates once a year.

Further details about my professional experience are (unfortunately) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-aubin/).

## AFK

I run the [Toronto Applied Rationality Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/less-wrong-toronto/) where we discuss complex topics with compassion, nuance, and mindfulness. I can also be found in mosh pits in the Toronto area.
