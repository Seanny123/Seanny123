### Hey! I'm Sean Aubin!

Pronouns: He/Him

I'm a punk trained in Electrical Engineering and Theoretical Neuroscience, but now mostly building computery tools for scientists. You can reach me casually [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/voyageur_techno). I also have [a blog](https://seanaubin.com/) that usually updates once a year.

## Employment

I'm both a Research Engineer at [ProteinQure](https://proteinqure.com/), as well as a Technical Writer Contractor for [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/).

## Open Source Contributions

I mostly contribute to Computational Biology projects written in Python, because they have a low barrier to entry for me to contribute meaningfully. However, if someone ever works on a [partial replacement for Rosetta using Julia](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/equivalent-to-rosetta-in-julia/32168?u=seanny123), please contact me! Finally, I still do a lot of review for [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai/)-related projects, since it's a project near and dear to my heart.

## Computery Interests

- [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/): Making computing collaborative and humane by embodying it in the world.
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/): Replacing C for low-level computation.
- [OilShell](https://www.oilshell.org/): An upgrade path from Bash to a better shell language.
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/): Ambitiously overcoming the two-language problem for scientists (using C++ libraries from R or Python) with gradual typing and meta-programming.
- [Human Systems Design](https://human-systems.org/): Designing systems (both digital and in-person) which allow for meaningful collaborations.
