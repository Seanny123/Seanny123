# Hey! I'm Sean Aubin!

I'm a punk trained in Electrical Engineering and [Theoretical Neuroscience](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/people/sean-aubin.html), which means I'm a data generalist competent in Machine Learning. I have [a blog](https://seanaubin.com/) that usually updates once a year.

Further details about my professional experience are (unfortunately) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-aubin/).

Feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn. I'm trying to avoid using Twitter and have not yet adopted another social network.
