# Hey! I'm Sean Aubin!

I'm a punk trained in Electrical Engineering and [Theoretical Neuroscience](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/people/sean-aubin.html), but now mostly building computery tools for scientists. You can reach me casually [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/voyageur_techno). I also have [a blog](https://seanaubin.com/) that usually updates once a year.

## Employment

I'm a Research Engineer at [ProteinQure](https://proteinqure.com/) trying to reduce scientist suffering. Further details about my professional experience are (unfortunately) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-aubin/).

## Open Source Contributions

I mostly contribute to Computational Biology projects written in Python, because of their low barrier to entry for me. Additionally, I still do a lot of review for [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai/)-related projects, since it's a project near and dear to my heart.

## Computery Interests

- [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/): Making computing collaborative and humane by embodying it in the world.
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/): Replacing C for low-level computation.
- [OilShell](https://www.oilshell.org/): An upgrade path from Bash to a better shell language.
- [Human Systems Design](https://human-systems.org/): Designing systems (both digital and in-person) which allow for meaningful collaborations.

## AFK

I run the [Toronto Applied Rationality Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/less-wrong-toronto/) where we discuss complex topics with compassion, nuance, and mindfulness. I can also be found in mosh pits in the Toronto area.
